Writing a C Compiler

The book recommends using an implementation language with "pattern matching"
features. I think the "prototyped" status of this RFC means GNAT supports that.
I'm also pretty sure this is just syntactic sugar for a bunch of successive
`elsif` blocks, so I think I can manage even if it isn't well supported.
